## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start working on your new project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

To start a new project using this template, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-new-project.git
cd your-new-project
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies:

#### On macOS/Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install any dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start Developing

You're now ready to start developing your project. Modify the `src/main.py` file and add any additional modules or packages as needed.

### 5. Managing Environment Variables

You can define environment-specific variables in the `.env` file. This file is ignored by Git to keep sensitive information secure. Add any necessary variables there, such as API keys, database credentials, etc.

### 6. Committing Changes

Remember to commit your changes often:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin main
```
